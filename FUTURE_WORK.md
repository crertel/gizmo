# Future Work

Ideas that aren't on the current roadmap but could be worth revisiting later.

## Frame Tagging

Tag frames with metadata like `code`, `quote`, or security taint markers. This
could enable:

- **Taint tracking for prompt injection.** Mark frames derived from untrusted
  input (user messages, external API responses) so downstream ops can treat
  them differently—e.g., refusing to `send` to `bash` from a tainted frame.
- **Rendering hints.** A `code` tag could tell the human adapter to syntax
  highlight, or a `quote` tag could indicate verbatim content that shouldn't
  be paraphrased by the LLM.
- **Audit trails.** Tags could record which op or cycle produced a frame,
  making the context stack's history inspectable.

No concrete design yet. The mechanism (how tags are attached, propagated, and
checked) matters more than the use cases listed above.
